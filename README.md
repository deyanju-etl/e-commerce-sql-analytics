#   E-commerce SQL Analytics Project using Microsoft SQL 

This project explores an E-commerce dataset using SQL.  
The goal was to perform **end-to-end data analysis** starting from table creation and data import, through exploratory SQL queries, and ending with integration into Power BI dashboards.  

## Steps Performed
1. **Created tables** for customers, orders, order items, products, sellers, geolocation, and reviews.  
2. **Imported flat files (CSV)** into SQL Server.  
3. **Explored the data** with queries:
   - Total orders & revenue
   - Average order value
   - Delivery time analysis
   - Top product categories and sellers
   - Orders by state and payment methods
4. **Advanced SQL analysis**:
   - Joins across multiple tables
   - Subqueries
   - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
   - Window functions (YoY growth, ranking sellers)
5. **Power BI Dashboard** built with KPIs and visuals:
   - Executive Overview (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Delivery Days)
   - Customer Insights (Map, State Distribution)
   - Seller Performance (Top sellers, Delivery outcomes)
   - Product Insights (Review score, Category sales)
   - Delivery & Logistics (On-time delivery rate)

## Tech Stack
- SQL Server (T-SQL)  
- Power BI  
- Python (EDA support with Pandas & Matplotlib)

## Outcomes
- Answered key business questions such as:
  - Which product categories drive the most revenue?
  - What is the YoY growth trend in orders and revenue?
  - How do delivery times impact cancellations?
  - Which states contribute most to revenue?
- Delivered a Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends.
